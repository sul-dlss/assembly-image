Prerequisites:

    Perl 

    Kakadu Software Binaries - for JP2 generation

       Download and install demonstration binaries from Kakadu:
       http://www.kakadusoftware.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=22

       Note: The binaries will not work with RHEL 5.x; an RPM for RHEL 5 with
       compatible binaries comming soon.

    Imagemagick 6.5 or higher
            
       RHEL 6: 

           # yum install ImageMagick

           The version of ImageMagick included with RHEL 6 has all of the
           dependency libraries included.
           
       RHEL 5: (RPM to install with included binaries comming soon)

           The version of ImageMagic included with RHEL 5 is too old and does
           not have all the proper binaries included/built

           Required libraries are:
           yum install lcms lcms-devel libtiff libtiff-devel libjpeg \
                       libjpeg-devel libpng libpng-devel
